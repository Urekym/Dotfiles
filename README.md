# dotfiles
simply saving my config here—nothing interesting.

# My setup Requirements
* any linux distro, i prefer Arch, Debian
* i3wm, xfce4
* Internet Connection
* Text Editors?, a long personal conflict, but now i'm comfortable with vscode, vim for quick edit
* Minecraft, some MMORPG game if i can


# Desktop environment
I keep my desktop theme simple with just the default i3wm settings—no extra customization. 
The i3status bar shows me everything i need:
* CPU usage
* battery life
* RAM status
* current time
* internet status
  
It's a clean and straightforward setup that suits my preference for simplicity.

And YES, I was that addicted guy who's tiling everything.   shout-out to "r/unixporn"
