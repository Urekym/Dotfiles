# dotfiles
Simply saving my i3wm config here—nothing interesting.

# My setup Requirements
* any Linux Distro, I prefer Arch
* Alacritty
* Internet Connection
* Vim, Neovim
* Minecraft, some MMORPG game if i can.


# Desktop environment
I keep my desktop theme simple with just the default i3wm settings—no extra customization. 
The i3status bar shows me everything i need: CPU usage, battery life, RAM status, current time, and internet connection. 
It's a clean and straightforward setup that suits my preference for simplicity.

And YES, I was that guy who's tiling everything. "r/unixporn"
