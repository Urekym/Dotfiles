# dotfiles
Simply saving my config here—nothing interesting.

# My setup Requirements
* any linux distro, I prefer Arch
* i3wm
* Alacritty
* Internet Connection
* Text Editors?, a long personal war, but now i'm comfortable with Vim
* Minecraft, some MMORPG game if i can.


# Desktop environment
I keep my desktop theme simple with just the default i3wm settings—no extra customization. 
The i3status bar shows me everything i need:
* CPU usage
* battery life
* RAM status
* current time
* internet status
  
It's a clean and straightforward setup that suits my preference for simplicity.

And YES, I was that addicted guy who's tiling everything. "r/unixporn"
